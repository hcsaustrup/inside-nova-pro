# TODO

* Find working ARMHF package repository for Debian Wheezy, allowing us to install additional packages.
* Uncover is this is actually a plain vanilla Debian or Linaro or Yocto or something like it.
* Figure out how `iotc_main` is communicating with the 433 MHz radio.
* Find a newer Linux distribution for the device. This requires knowledge of device trees.
* Build a Go application that can talk to the 433 MHz radio and other peripherals.
* Figure out an easier way to gain access to the device.
