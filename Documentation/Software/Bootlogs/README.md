# Boot Logs

This directory contains boot logs from various versions of the device.

## A word of caution

### Anonymize data

In case the company behind the NOVA alarm decides to disagree with our right to
mess with our own purchased hardware, it is highly recommended to remove any IP or
hardware addresses from files added to this repository.

### Remove copyrighted material

While booting up, the kernel may dump binary data containing secret keys or
copyrighted material. Please do not add this to this repository, as it may open up
legal issues we're not prepared to handle at this point.
